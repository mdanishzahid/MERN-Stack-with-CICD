# Introduction to Create React App

This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage Scripts

Within the project directory, you have the following commands available:

### `npm start`

Initiates the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will refresh upon making changes.\
Any lint errors may also be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Activates the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more details.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the app for production, creating the `build` folder.\
It appropriately bundles React in production mode and optimizes for optimal performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include unique hashes.\
Your app is now ready for deployment!

Refer to the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for additional information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Ejecting cannot be reversed!**

If you find the build tool and configuration choices unsatisfactory, you can eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

It copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, providing full control. All commands, except `eject`, continue to work, pointing to the copied scripts for customization.

While ejecting is optional, it offers complete customization when you are ready.
